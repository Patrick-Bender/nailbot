This project has the following spec:

Two robotic arms will use a "nail gun" to nail together two planks and place them in a specific position that they can only achieve if they are nailed together

Reward function should take into account:
How close the planks are to the specified position
Are they nailed together
Are the arms touching them (negative points if they make contact or are close to it)
Can it support itself
Punished for pulling the nailgun more than is necessary

Slowly work up to the full thing:
first- just manipulate one in front of the nailgun
second- add another plank and have it in position
third- flip it over to form an upside down V
