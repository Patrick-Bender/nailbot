End goal of this project is to get two robotic arms to use a nail gun to nail together two planks and place them in a specific position that they can only achieve if they are nailed together

Currently, there is just one robotic arm trying to pick up and move a cube 90 degrees to the right.

I've given up on using machine learning to drive the robot's decisionmaking, it's just not feasable since I would need more compute than I have available to make it work.
It may have some future role in object detection, but that woln't be for a while.
