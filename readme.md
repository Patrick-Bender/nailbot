Nailbot is a simulation to demonstrate that you can build small wooden structures using two robotic arms (in this case, a bird house). The idea behind this is that you can lever up from building a bird house to a shed to a garage to a house, all using robots on site.

Post Mortem: Unfortunately the physics simulation wasn't really up to scratch to fully complete this project in the time that I would've liked. As you can see at the end, the gripper clips through the object. While I tried for a few days to remedy that, nothing I did worked and I figured that I wouldn't learn that much even if I did worked it out, so I gave up there and bought a real robotic arm to test it out.
